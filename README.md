# To use
Right click when holding 357 to toss coin, up to 4 times. After a slight delay, you can shoot your coin. Struck coins will target other coins and players.

If someone else chucked a coin, shoot it before they can to totally meme them.

Coins will recharge over time and you will receive a notification.

Add players to blacklist and whitelist so you can choose who is targetted.

Coins can be punted with Gravity Gun for extra range
