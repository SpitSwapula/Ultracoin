# Ultracoin
An Expression2 script that ports Ultrakill's Marksman/coinshot ability to Garry's Mod

An overwhelming majority of this code is written by the lovely Katsu

# Installation
Just clone in, SSH, or pull the zip file.

Drop Ultracoin.txt into ProgramFiles/Steam/Steamapps/Common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/data/expression2

# Intallation Explained
First make sure you have Wiremod, Plycore, Antcore and Nexuscore installed through the workshop.

Propcore is already inside of Wiremod but must be enabled by commandline.

Download ultracoin as a zip file using the "code" dropdown in github, colored as a green box.

If opening Garry'sMod directory through steam, right click the game in the library, go to properties, local files, browse local files. Then navigate the folders to get to "Garry'sMod/garrysmod/data/expression2"

Place the script text files into the expression2 folder.

If your game was already running, open the wire tab of your spawnmenu, open the Expression2 tool, and click "update" to refresh all available script listings so that the recently added scripts now show up.

Both Ultracoin and Ultramove go into the steam/steamapps/common/Garrys Mod/garrysmod/data/expression2 
Folder

But the PAC3 file included in ultramove.zip needs to be placed into Garrys Mod/garrysmod/data/pac3


A few necessary in-game console commands are

wire_holograms_modelany 1

wire_expression2_extension_enable propcore

wire_expression2_concmd 1

The first command allows the new vfx for coinshot to show, the second allows it to even work, and the third allows the movement E2 to play the PAC's sliding animation on your playermodel

# To use
Right click when holding 357 to toss coin, up to 4 times. After a slight delay, you can shoot your coin. Struck coins will target other coins and players.

If someone else chucked a coin, shoot it before they can to totally meme them.

Coins will recharge over time and you will receive a notification.

Add players to blacklist and whitelist so you can choose who is targetted.

Coins can be punted with Gravity Gun for extra range
